# hello-world
This is a test repository made following the GitHub tutorial 
So this is my first time using GitHub for anything besides reading Comma.ai files. Hopefuly I don't screw this up. We only have the rental car for one more day and I really don't want to send the ting back with nothing to show for my work. I want to make sure all the effort Andy put in wasn't wasted.
